      <h3>Welcome Brew.</h3>

<p>Four young, driven entrepreneurs from Ottawa Ontario seeking initial funding to start our company. Our vision is to replace the "grind" mindset of the coffee culture, with the easy going lifestyle associated with surfing. </p>


<h3>What we are about</h3>

<p>This will be achieved via a portable cart that is one of a kind, handmade by our team. The drinks sold will be locally scoured, affordable and one of a kind. It will provide a unique coffee experience within the capital that won't be found anywhere else. </p>
<p>We will sell authentic drinks, directly to the customers without being bound to a single location. The portability of our stand guarantees convenience for all of our customers. </p>

<h3>Our Team</h3>

<p>Nathanael Slow, Co-founder and Co-CEO, Erica van Wyk, Co-founder and CMO, Akshay Vig, Co-founder and Co-CEO, Behar Deda, Co-founder and CSO</p>
